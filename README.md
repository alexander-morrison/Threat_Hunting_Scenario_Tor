# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized TOR Usage
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/alexander-morrison/Threat_Hunting_Scenario_Tor/blob/master/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-event-creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 11 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

##  Scenario

Management believes that certain employees may be using TOR browsers to circumvent network security controls, as recent network logs reveal unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, anonymous reports suggest that some employees have been discussing methods to access restricted websites during work hours. The objective is to identify any TOR activity and examine related security incidents to reduce potential risks. If TOR usage is detected, management should be informed.

### High-Level TOR-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `tor(.exe)` or `firefox(.exe)` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of installation or usage.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

Searched for any file that had the string "tor" in it and discovered what looks like the user "employee" downloaded a TOR installer, did something that resulted in many TOR-related files being copied to the desktop, and the creation of a file called `tor-shopping-list.txt` on the desktop at `2026-02-26T15:00:01`. These events began at `2026-02-26T14:44:30`.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "labuser"  
| where FileName contains "tor"  
| where Timestamp >= datetime(2026-02-26T22:44:26.1674012Z)  
| order by Timestamp desc  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched for any `ProcessCommandLine` that contained the string "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-15.0.7.exe". Based on the logs returned, at `2026-02-26T22:47:46.0319694Z`, a labuser on the "threat-hunt-lab" device ran the file `tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-15.0.7.exe` from their Downloads folder, using a command that triggered a silent installation.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-15.0.7.exe"  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for TOR Browser Execution

Searched for any indication that user "labuser" actually opened the TOR browser. There was evidence that they did open it at `2026-02-26T14:48:09`. There were several other instances of `firefox.exe` (TOR) as well as `tor.exe` spawned afterwards.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor-browser.exe")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine  
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

Searched for any indication the TOR browser was used to establish a connection using any of the known TOR ports. At `2026-02-26T22:48:42.8691078Z`, a labuser on the "threat-hunt-lab" device successfully established a connection to the remote IP address `176.198.159.33` on port `9001`. The connection was initiated by the process `tor.exe`, located in the folder `c:\users\employee\desktop\tor browser\browser\torbrowser\tor\tor.exe`. There were a couple of other connections to sites over port `443`.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName != "system"  
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")  
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9040", "9050", "9051", "9150", "80", "443")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath  
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## Summary

The timeline demonstrates the installation and usage of the Tor browser by a user (labuser). The process began with downloading the installer and executing it both normally and silently for installation. This was followed by the launch of the Tor browser, leading to network connections through the Tor SOCKS proxy and remote relays. Finally, the creation of the suspicious file tor-shopping-list.txt and its shortcuts suggests potentially illicit or investigative activity. Further analysis of the file contents is recommended.

---

## Response Taken

TOR usage was confirmed on the endpoint `threat-hunt-lab` by the user `labuser`. The device was isolated, and the user's direct manager was notified.
